# MBPP Task 001: Programming Challenge

## Objective
Write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].

## Requirements
1. Implement the solution in a Python function
2. The function should handle all the test cases provided
3. Write your solution to `./output/min_cost.py`
4. Make sure your code passes all the provided tests

## Test Cases
The following test cases will be used to validate your solution:
1. `assert min_cost([[1, 2, 3], [4, 8, 2], [1, 5, 3]], 2, 2) == 8`
2. `assert min_cost([[2, 3, 4], [5, 9, 3], [2, 6, 4]], 2, 2) == 12`
3. `assert min_cost([[3, 4, 5], [6, 10, 4], [3, 7, 5]], 2, 2) == 16`

## Scoring Criteria
- **Compilation (1 point)**: Python script runs without syntax errors
- **Test Validation (1 point)**: All test cases pass successfully

## Notes
- Focus on correctness and handling edge cases
- Your solution will be tested against the provided test cases
- Make sure to follow Python best practices
