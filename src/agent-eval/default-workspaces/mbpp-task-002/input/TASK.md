# MBPP Task 002: Programming Challenge

## Objective
Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.

## Requirements
1. Implement the solution in a Python function
2. The function should handle all the test cases provided
3. Write your solution to `./output/similar_elements.py`
4. Make sure your code passes all the provided tests

## Test Cases
The following test cases will be used to validate your solution:
1. `assert similar_elements((3, 4, 5, 6),(5, 7, 4, 10)) == (4, 5)`
2. `assert similar_elements((1, 2, 3, 4),(5, 4, 3, 7)) == (3, 4)`
3. `assert similar_elements((11, 12, 14, 13),(17, 15, 14, 13)) == (13, 14)`

## Scoring Criteria
- **Compilation (1 point)**: Python script runs without syntax errors
- **Test Validation (1 point)**: All test cases pass successfully

## Notes
- Focus on correctness and handling edge cases
- Your solution will be tested against the provided test cases
- Make sure to follow Python best practices
