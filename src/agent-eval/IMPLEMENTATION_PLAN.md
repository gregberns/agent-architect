# Agent Evaluation and Evolution System - Implementation Tracking

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Steps 1-5)

### Step 1: Directory Restructure and Epoch-001 Creation ✅
**Status**: Completed

### Step 2: Default Workspaces Creation ✅
**Status**: Completed

### Step 3: Job Queue Core Implementation ♻️
**Status**: Refactored
**Objective**: Implement a job management system.
**Update**: The file-based job queue (`job_queue.py`) and persistent daemon (`orchestrator.py`) proved unreliable. The system has been refactored to use an in-memory task management system within `evaluate_epoch.py` powered by Python's `multiprocessing.Pool`. This new approach is simpler, more robust, and provides better real-time logging.

### Step 3.5: Testing and Validation of Foundation Components ✅
**Status**: Completed

### Step 4: Orchestrator Core ♻️
**Status**: Refactored
**Objective**: Main job queue manager with worker process management.
**Update**: The `orchestrator.py` daemon and separate worker scripts have been removed. `evaluate_epoch.py` is now the sole orchestrator for evaluation runs, managing a pool of processes directly. This resolves issues with zombie processes and simplifies the execution model.

### Step 5: Basic Configuration System ✅
**Status**: Completed
**Objective**: Configurable parallelism and timeouts.
**Deliverables**:
- [x] Configuration system with JSON persistence (`config_simple.py`, `config.json`).
- [x] Configurable parallelism (`max_concurrent_jobs`).
- [x] Configurable timeouts for different task types.

## Phase 2: Core Evaluation System (Steps 6-10)

### Step 6: Task Worker Implementation ♻️
**Status**: Refactored
**Objective**: Execute individual task evaluations with Docker.
**Update**: Logic from `task-worker.py` has been moved into a worker function directly within `evaluate_epoch.py`, called by the `multiprocessing.Pool`.

### Step 7: Evaluation Orchestrator ✅
**Status**: Completed
**Objective**: Enqueue and manage epoch evaluation jobs.
**Deliverables**:
- [x] `evaluate_epoch.py` script with a simple CLI interface.
- [x] Copies default-workspaces to the epoch's `runs/` directory.
- [x] Manages parallel execution of evaluation and validation tasks.
- [x] Provides real-time progress and error logging.
- [x] Generates a final evaluation summary.

### Step 8: Validation Worker System ♻️
**Status**: Refactored
**Objective**: Automated code execution and test validation.
**Update**: Logic from `validation-worker.py` has been moved into a worker function within `evaluate_epoch.py`.

### Step 9: Metrics Collection System ✅
**Status**: Completed
**Objective**: Aggregate scores and generate performance reports.
**Deliverables**:
- [x] Metrics collection system in `evaluation/metrics-collectors/`.
- [x] Scoring calculation (per-task and per-epoch).
- [x] Generation of JSON/CSV reports.

### Step 10: End-to-End Evaluation Pipeline ✅
**Status**: Completed
**Objective**: Complete automated pipeline: task execution → validation → metrics.
**Completed Deliverables**:
- [x] A single command (`python3 orchestrator/evaluate_epoch.py`) now runs the entire pipeline.
- [x] The pipeline is self-contained, robust, and provides immediate feedback.
- [x] All intermediate state is managed in memory, avoiding file-based queue corruption.

### Step 10.1: Testing Framework Implementation ✅
**Status**: Completed

## Phase 3: Evolution System (Steps 11-15)

### Step 11: Evolution Worker Implementation ⏸️
**Status**: Pending
**Next Step**: Design an `evolve_epoch.py` script, likely using the same `multiprocessing.Pool` pattern as the refactored `evaluate_epoch.py` to manage long-running evolution tasks.

### Step 12: Evolution Orchestrator ⏸️
**Status**: Pending

### Step 13: Evolution Task Templates ⏸️
**Status**: Pending

### Step 14: Cross-Epoch Evaluation ⏸️
**Status**: Pending

### Step 15: Evolution Pipeline Integration ⏸️
**Status**: Pending

## Phase 4: Production Features (Steps 16-20)

### Step 16: Rate Limiting and Retry Logic ⏸️
**Status**: Pending

### Step 17: Job Persistence and Recovery ♻️
**Status**: Obsolete
**Update**: The requirement for persistence and recovery of a single evaluation run has been removed in favor of a simpler, more reliable, atomic execution model. If a run fails, it can be restarted from the beginning.

### Step 18: Monitoring and Dashboard ⏸️
**Status**: Pending

### Step 19: Performance Optimization ⏸️
**Status**: Pending

### Step 20: Documentation and Testing ⏸️
**Status**: Pending
