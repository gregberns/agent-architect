- [x] Validate epoch-001 agent can execute a sample task (‚úÖ Docker runs, API rate limited)
- [x] Test job queue persistence and recovery (‚úÖ Full persistence test passed)
- [x] Validate configuration loading and defaults (‚úÖ JSON config system working)
- [x] End-to-end test: copy task to epoch runs, execute via docker (‚úÖ Complete pipeline tested)
- [x] Comprehensive test suite created and all tests passing (4/4)

### Step 4: Orchestrator Core ‚úÖ
**Status**: Completed
**Objective**: Main job queue manager with worker process management
**Deliverables**:
- [x] Create `orchestrator.py` main job queue manager
- [x] Implement worker process spawning and monitoring (3 worker types)
- [x] Add job distribution to workers (task, evolution, validation)
- [x] Create CLI interface: --start, --status, --stop, --retry-failed
- [x] Implement graceful shutdown and cleanup with signal handling
- [x] Create all worker scripts (task-worker.py, evolution-worker.py, validation-worker.py)
- [x] Test orchestrator functionality (3/3 tests passed)

### Step 5: Basic Configuration System ‚úÖ
**Status**: Completed (implemented in Step 3)
**Objective**: Configurable parallelism and rate limiting
**Deliverables**:
- [x] Configuration system with JSON persistence
- [x] Configurable parallelism (max_concurrent_jobs, worker counts)
- [x] Rate limiting configuration (api_requests_per_minute, retry_backoff)
- [x] Timeout configuration (task_execution_timeout, evolution_timeout, validation_timeout)
- [x] Default configuration generation and loading

## Phase 2: Core Evaluation System (Steps 6-10)

### Step 6: Task Worker Implementation ‚úÖ
**Status**: Completed (implemented in Step 4)
**Objective**: Execute individual task evaluations with Docker
**Deliverables**:
- [x] Create `task-worker.py` with Docker compose execution
- [x] Log capture and output collection
- [x] Error handling and timeout management  
- [x] Result packaging and reporting
- [x] Integration with job queue system

### Step 7: Evaluation Orchestrator ‚úÖ
**Status**: Completed
**Objective**: Enqueue and manage epoch evaluation jobs
**Deliverables**:
- [x] Create `evaluate_epoch.py` script with CLI interface
- [x] Copy default-workspaces to epoch/runs/ functionality
- [x] Enqueue individual task jobs for each workspace
- [x] Monitor completion and collect results with timeout
- [x] Parallel execution with configurable concurrency
- [x] Generate evaluation summaries with JSON output
- [x] Test suite with 3/3 tests passed

### Step 8: Validation Worker System ‚úÖ
**Status**: Completed (implemented in Step 4)
**Objective**: Automated code execution and test validation
**Deliverables**:
- [x] Create `validation-worker.py` with code execution
- [x] Test runner integration (pytest) with timeout handling
- [x] Binary scoring system (compilation + test success)
- [x] Results aggregation and storage in job artifacts
- [x] Integration with job queue system

### Step 9: Metrics Collection System ‚úÖ
**Status**: Completed
**Objective**: Aggregate scores and generate performance reports
**Deliverables**:
- [x] Create metrics collection system in `evaluation/metrics-collectors/`
- [x] Implement scoring calculation (per-task and per-epoch)
- [x] Generate JSON/CSV reports for epoch performance
- [x] Create comparison tools for cross-epoch analysis
- [x] Integrate with validation results (2-point scoring system)
- [x] Unified CLI interface for all metrics operations
- [x] Comprehensive test suite and documentation

### Step 10: End-to-End Evaluation Pipeline üîÑ
**Status**: Needs Revision
**Objective**: Complete automated pipeline: task execution ‚Üí validation ‚Üí metrics
**Current Issues**:
- evaluate_epoch.py doesn't automatically trigger validation jobs
- metrics_cli shows "No evaluation job found" - disconnect between systems
- Scoring system needs update (2-point ‚Üí 3-point system)
- Runtime files mixed with source code (poor organization)
- Debug scripts scattered throughout codebase

**Revised Deliverables**:
- [x] Pipeline chaining: automatically enqueue validation jobs after task completion
- [x] Fix metrics integration with job queue system
- [x] Update scoring system: 1pt task completion + 1pt no errors + 1pt tests pass
- [x] Reorganize file structure: separate runtime/logs from source code
- [x] Consolidate debug/test scripts
- [x] Test complete end-to-end pipeline
