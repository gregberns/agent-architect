## Identified Queue System Issues

Based on analysis of debug_* and test_* files, these issues have been identified:

### Core Problems
1. **Job Queue Corruption**: JSON integrity issues in job_queue.json file
2. **Worker Process Coordination**: Workers not properly polling or processing jobs
3. **Job Monitoring Disconnects**: evaluate_epoch loses track of enqueued jobs
4. **Docker Execution Issues**: Container execution failures in task workers
5. **Queue State Inconsistency**: Jobs stuck in RUNNING state, not transitioning properly

### Specific Issues Found
- **Queue File Integrity**: Need validation and recovery for corrupted JSON
- **Worker Communication**: Workers may not be finding jobs even when they exist
- **Job State Transitions**: Jobs not properly moving between PENDING → RUNNING → COMPLETED
- **Process Management**: Orchestrator worker spawning and monitoring issues
- **Docker Environment**: Container execution and file mounting problems
- **Timeout Handling**: Jobs hanging without proper timeout management

### Testing Gaps
- No comprehensive test suite covering all failure modes
- Manual debug scripts scattered throughout codebase
- No automated way to validate system health after changes
- Limited integration testing between components
- No performance/stress testing under load
